                            distributor convention in Athens</span>, gathering 120 attendees. The client sought a creative concept rooted in the city’s

                        <p>To develop a <span class="highlighted-text">concept that resonates with the event’s location</span> and the brand’s values, 
                            we investigated the rich history of Greece, a civilization that laid the foundations for Western culture.</p>

                        <p>The Greeks made significant contributions to mathematics, astronomy, philosophy and the arts, influencing countless generations. 
                            Additionally, <span class="highlighted-text">the Greeks were pioneers in trade</span>, establishing marketplaces 
                            (agoras) where goods and ideas were exchanged, fostering innovation and collaboration.</p>

                        <p>Through literature review, three primary concepts emerged. These concepts not only pay homage to Greece's rich history but also 
                            open <span class="highlighted-text">numerous opportunities for engagement</span>:</p>

                                <p>Mythology offers timeless symbols of strategy, power, and transformation, aligning well with CND’s event. This concept would 
                                    connect Greek mythological figures with CND’s core values, invoking a sense of history, strength, and inspiration for attendees.</p>

                                     Greece as the origin of astrology, integrating it as a tool for wisdom, purpose, and connection to energy—a trend increasingly

                        <p>A survey was conducted with the internal marketing team to gauge audience interest</span> in the three proposed concepts: 
                            Ancient Greek Astrology, Greek Mythology, and the Agora. The results highlighted a <span class="highlighted-text">growing trend 
                            and fascination with horoscopes</span>, which reflect a direct connection to astrology as a tool for wisdom, purpose, and energy

                        <p>Based on these insights, <span class="highlighted-text">the client selected astrology as the final concept</span>,

                        <p>In Ancient Greece, astrology was more than a mystical belief—it was a <span class="highlighted-text">guiding tool deeply embedded in 
                            personal and societal decision-making</span>. Ancient Greeks turned to the stars for <span class="highlighted-text">advice on 
                            commerce</span>, navigation, and the success of their ventures. They believed the alignment of celestial bodies could influence 
                            events on Earth, providing insights into timing, strategy, and outcomes.</p>
                        
                        <p>This historical significance makes astrology a fitting concept for the annual convention of CND. Just as the Greeks used astrology 
                            to navigate their world, <span class="highlighted-text">today’s businesses can draw inspiration from this practice</span> to make
                            informed decisions and achieve growth. Astrology resonates with the event’s theme of collective collaboration, and positionates 
                            the event as sophisticated and <span class="highlighted-text">connected to the rich history of Ancient Greece</span>.</p>

                    <h1>LEARNINGS</h1>

                    <p>Working on the Above the Stars project has been an <span class="highlighted-text">enriching experience</span> that has significantly 
                        expanded my skills as a designer. The challenge of translating a complex, abstract concept like astrology into a visually 
                        engaging and cohesive identity has deepened my understanding of how to <span class="highlighted-text">balance thematic creativity 
                        with functional design</span>. I learned the importance of aligning every element—from the logo design to the personalized 
                        astrology kits—around a central, unifying concept. This taught me how to craft an immersive experience that resonates with 
                        the audience while staying true to the brand values.</p>

                    <p>The project also strengthened my ability to work with <span class="highlighted-text">multiple touchpoints</span>, ensuring consistency 
                        across both digital and physical materials. Developing an event’s visual identity required a keen <span class="highlighted-text">
                        attention to detail</span> and a strategic approach to how each piece would connect with the audience. The challenge of 
                        incorporating personalized, interactive elements into the design process pushed me to think outside the box and to explore how 
                        design can create deeper connections with attendees.</p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, the feedback I received from testing the concept with real users was invaluable. It provided me with insight into 
                        how to refine my designs to <span class="highlighted-text">meet user needs</span> more effectively, whether it was improving 
                        usability, readability, or engagement. Through this, I gained a deeper appreciation for the iterative process and the importance 
                        of <span class="highlighted-text">continually testing and refining designs</span> to create a more impactful experience.</p>

                    <p>Overall, Above the Stars has honed my skills in conceptualizing, designing, and executing a large-scale event experience. It has 
                        taught me how to seamlessly <span class="highlighted-text">integrate storytellin</span> with visual design to create an experience 
                        that not only engages but also resonates with the audience. This project has been a significant milestone in my growth as a 
                        designer, pushing me to continuously improve and innovate in my craft.
