                        <p>The issue of <span class="highlighted-text">food waste</span> is one of the most 
                            pressing challenges facing the world today, encompassing both social and environmental considerations. By throwing away food, we 
                            are also wasting the <span class="highlighted-text">resources</span> and <span class="highlighted-text">energy</span> used in its 
                            cultivation, harvesting, transportation, and packaging. The extent of this problem can be seen in the statistics from the 
                            World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which reports that <span class="highlighted-text">food waste is responsible for 10% of total greenhouse 
                            gas emissions</span>, a staggering amount that rivals the emissions produced by all cars in the US and Europe combined.</p>

                        <p>We began by identifying the ages that fall under the <span class="highlighted-text">young people</span> group. According to 
                            the United Nations, these are persons between the ages of 15 and 24 years. However, 
                            since our challenge relates to consumption, we expanded this by identifying what ages are classified as 
                            a <span class="highlighted-text">young consumer - a person who purchases goods and services for personal use</span>.</p>

                        <p>At the start of the project, we recognized our limited understanding of the challenges related to food consumption and waste. To 
                            bridge this gap, we conducted <span class="highlighted-text">research to better understand the target audience’s lifestyle</span>

                        <p>We applied various <span class="highlighted-text">ideation techniques</span> to design an appropriate solution to the problem. 
                            After conducting a <span class="highlighted-text">benchmark</span>, we noticed that many of our ideas from the first brainstorming 
                            sessions were already launched in the <span class="highlighted-text">apps market</span>. To address this, we reevaluated our 
                            <span class="highlighted-text">research data</span>, explored new concepts, and combined ideas from different brainstorming sessions. 
                            This process led us to two main concepts:</p>

                        <p><b>→ CONCEPT 1:</b> A portal that has access to possible solutions in preventing harmful food waste.</p>

                        <p><b>→ CONCEPT 2:</b> A community platform facilitating easy and convenient access to food banks or solidarity fridges in the area.</p>   

                        <p>We chose to move forward with Concept 1, as it aligned better with our goal. However, we decided not to proceed with this approach because <span class="highlighted-text">it risked becoming a simple information 
                            dump</span>, which would fail to offer an engaging and actionable experience for users.</p>
                        
                        <p>At this point, our goal became clear:</p>

                        <p>During the Understand phase, we discovered that <span class="highlighted-text">Google is the go-to platform</span> for users seeking information and 
                            solving everyday problems. To delve deeper, we conducted a <span class="highlighted-text">usability test</span> to observe how users interact with 
                            Google, focusing on their behaviors, priorities, and frustrations.</p>

                        <p>User feedback revealed that <span class="highlighted-text">information on Google</span> is often <span class="highlighted-text">scattered</span>, 
                            overly complex, and occasionally <span class="highlighted-text">inaccurate</span>. This insight led us to explore ways to simplify and enhance 
                            the process of accessing <span class="highlighted-text">reliable information</span>, especially for practical use in the 
                            <span class="highlighted-text">kitchen</span>, such as during meal preparation or organizing the <span class="highlighted-text">pantry/fridge</span>.</p>

                        <p>Given the context of use and the need to reach a wider audience, we chose to design a <span class="highlighted-text">mobile app</span>. Research 
                            indicated that the number of <span class="highlighted-text">internet users</span> relying on <span class="highlighted-text">mobile devices</span> has 
                            grown exponentially in recent years, far surpassing desktop usage.</p>

                            However, recognizing this scope was too wide, we conducted a survey with <span class="highlighted-text">200 young professionals</span> in 
                            Barcelona, aiming to pinpoint the most <span class="highlighted-text">consumed and wasted</span> items within our target audience.</p>

                        <p>Based on the survey results (see graphs below), <span class="highlighted-text">potatoes emerged as one of the most purchased yet wasted 
                            ingredients</span>. This insight guided us to narrow our designs, centering on this ingredient to create a user-centered solution (the MVP will include more fruits and vegetables).</p>

                    <h1>LEARNINGS</h1>
                    
                    <p><span class="highlighted-text">Responsible consumption</span> is a huge topic to tackle, 
                        so we decided to focus on the issue of <span class="highlighted-text">food waste</span> to 
                        narrow down the area of investigation and seek viable solutions. The food waste issue is not a 
                        new topic of interest: many people have attempted to solve this problem, and numerous applications 
                        already exist but <span class="highlighted-text">are not always effective</span>.This made it more 
                        challenging for us, as we had to figure out a <span class="highlighted-text">user-centered solution</span> 
                        to address the issue in a way that brings <span class="highlighted-text">value</span> to the users.</p>
                    
                    <p>The development of Foodle required extensive research and the application of <span class="highlighted-text">design 
                        thinking techniques</span> and a significant amount of time was spent on desk research, interviews, data 
                        analysis, and ideation. One of the misconceptions we had was the idea to improve the experience of food 
                        organization and planning from when users shop for groceries. This was a mistake because <span class="highlighted-text">
                        many of the ideas we generated already exist</span>. When we assessed these ideas against the 
                        problems and needsof the users, we realized they <span class="highlighted-text">didn’t directly solve the issues</span>. 
                        As a result, we had to revisit our data and re-sort it.</p>

                    <p>We were reminded by our teachers <span class="highlighted-text">not to fall in love with the ideas we create</span>. 
                        It’s quite true as what I had observed with my team members. When we were so convinced with what we have 
                        formed and found out it’s not going to work, it disheartened us. So we knew we had to step up 
                        and put ourselves out to get to the solution concept we now have, that is, <span class="highlighted-text">an app that 
                        uses a decision tree to provide the appropriate method to maximize food use</span>.</p>

                    <p><span class="highlighted-text">Doing sprints was the key in making our design a success</span>. By testing our design 
                        ideas as we developed them, it allowed us to discover the usability issues fast and continuously improve the interface and 
                        experience of our digital product. It was liberating to learn that in creating a user-centered design, 
                        <span class="highlighted-text">nothing works perfectly for the first time</span> and there will always be something to enhance 
                        as you test it with different users. Hence, <span class="highlighted-text">it is crucial to identify the MVP of the product</span> 
                        to concentrate on the features that appeal more to the user.</p>

                    <p>If I were to do this project again, I would <span class="highlighted-text">form the interview questions differently</span> 
                        as a lot of them seemed redundant and I would look deeper into the people’s habits, what they really waste and what causes it. I 
                        would also <span class="highlighted-text">seek for an expert in the field</span> (which we have failed to do) to learn the 
                        viable ways to handle food accurately, and what they think we should do to avoid food wasting.</p>
