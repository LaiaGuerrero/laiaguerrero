                        <p>The issue of food waste is one of the <span class="highlighted-text">most pressing challenges facing the world today</span>, encompassing 
                        both social and environmental considerations. By throwing away food, we are also wasting the resources and energy used in its 
                        cultivation, harvesting, transportation, and packaging. The extent of this problem can be seen in the statistics from the 
                        World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which reports that <span class="highlighted-text">food waste is responsible for 10% of total greenhouse 
                        gas emissions</span>, a staggering amount that rivals the emissions produced by all cars in the US and Europe combined.</p>


                        <p>Only in Catalonia:</p>

                        <ul class="content-ul">
                            <li><span class="highlighted-text">62,000 tonnes of food is wasted annually</span>, 7% of total food purchased.</li>
                            <li>35 kg of food are wasted per inhabitant per year.</li>
                            <li>Households in Barcelona generate the most food waste in Catalonia, 58% of the total.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Target audience demographics</h3>

                        <p>We began by identifying the ages that fall under the young people group. According to the United Nations, these are persons between 
                        the ages of 15 and 24 years. However, since our challenge relates to consumption, we expanded this by identifying what ages are 
                        classified as a <span class="highlighted-text">young consumer - a person who purchases goods and services for personal use</span>.</p> 
                        
                        <p>According to different sources (Leger, PICTET, EuroMonitor, etc.) <span class="highlighted-text">young consumers as people under 
                            40 years</span>.

                        <p>At the start of the project, we recognized our limited understanding of the challenges related to food consumption and waste. To 
                            bridge this gap, we conducted <span class="highlighted-text">research to better understand the target audience’s lifestyle</span> 
                            and their approach to food management. We used the following research techniques:</p>

                        <ul class="content-ul">
                            <li><span class="highlighted-text">Informal interviews:</span> We interviewed 12 volunteers under the age of 40 who live in Barcelona and
                            claim to buy their own food.</li>
                            <li><span class="highlighted-text">Observation:</span> Some interviews were conducted in settings like restaurants or while participants
                            were cooking at home, allowing us to observe their habits related to food waste firsthand.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>During research, we focused in the following areas:</p>

                        brainstorming sessions. This process led us to two main concepts:</p>

                            <li><b>CONCEPT 2:</b> A community platform facilitating easy and convenient access to food banks or solidarity fridges in the area.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>We chose to move forward with Concept 1, as it aligned better with our goal. However, <span class="highlighted-text">we decided not to proceed 
                        with this approach because it risked becoming a simple information dump</span>, which would fail to offer an engaging and actionable experience 
                        for users.</p>

                        <p>During the Understand phase, we discovered that <span class="highlighted-text">Google is the go-to platform for users seeking information and 
                        solving everyday problems</span>. To delve deeper, we conducted a usability test to observe how users interact with

                        <p>User feedback revealed that <span class="highlighted-text">information on Google is often scattered, overly complex, and occasionally inaccurate</span>. 
                        This insight led us to <span class="highlighted-text">explore ways to simplify and enhance the process of accessing reliable information</span>, especially 
                        for practical use in the kitchen, such as during meal preparation or organizing the pantry/fridge.</p>

                        <p>Given the context of use and the need to reach a wider audience, <span class="highlighted-text">we chose to design a mobile app</span> since research

                        <p>Foodle is designed to <span class="highlighted-text">provide users with actionable, relevant information about their food choices</span>. 
                        To shape the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), we conducted research to identify commonly consumed and wasted 
                        foods, <span class="highlighted-text">leading us to prioritize fruits and vegetables</span>.</p> 

                        <p>Initially, we designed Foodle screens around the category of fruits and vegetables. However, recognizing this scope was too wide, 
                        <span class="highlighted-text">we conducted a survey with 200 young professionals in Barcelona, aiming to pinpoint the most consumed 
                        and wasted items</span> within our target audience.</p>

                        <p>Based on the survey results, <span class="highlighted-text">potatoes emerged as one of the most purchased yet wasted 
                        ingredients</span>. This insight guided us to narrow our designs, centering on this ingredient to create a user-centered MVP solution.</p>

                        <p>We also explored the <span class="highlighted-text">most effective and engaging ways to present information</span> in the app. 
                        Feedback from survey participants revealed their preferred learning formats and content styles, <span class="highlighted-text">with videos
                        and illustrations being the most voted options</span>.</p>

                        <h1>LEARNINGS & IMPACT</h1>
                        
                        <p>Responsible consumption and food waste are ongoing concerns. Many have attempted to address these issues, and numerous applications exist, yet 
                        they often fall short. This made our challenge even greater: we had to design a <span class="highlighted-text">user-centered solution that truly 
                        added value</span>.</p>

                        <p>Developing Foodle required extensive research and the application of <span class="highlighted-text">design thinking methodologies</span>. 
                        We invested significant time in desk research, interviews, data analysis, and ideation. Initially, we focused on improving food organization and 
                        planning from the moment users shop for groceries. However, <span class="highlighted-text">we soon realized this approach had already been 
                        explored</span> and did not directly address the core problem.</p>
                        
                        <p>One of the most valuable lessons was learning <span class="highlighted-text">not to get attached to our initial ideas</span>. When we discovered 
                        that some of our assumptions didn’t work, it was discouraging. However, pushing through this setback led us to a more effective solution: an app 
                        that uses a <span class="highlighted-text">decision tree</span> to recommend the best method for maximizing food use.</p>
                        
                        <p>Another key takeaway was the <span class="highlighted-text">importance of iterative testing</span>. Running sprints allowed us to quickly 
                        identify usability issues and continuously refine the interface and user experience. Defining the MVP early on helped us 
                        <span class="highlighted-text">focus on the features that were most valuable to users</span>.</p>
                        
                        <p>If I were to redo this project, I would refine our interview questions to <span class="highlighted-text">avoid redundancy and explore users’ 
                        habits more deeply</span>—what they waste and why. Additionally, consulting an expert in the field would have provided valuable insights into 
                        practical solutions for reducing food waste.</p>
                        
                        <p>Foodle was our final Master’s project for the Master’s in User Experience and Interface Design at ESDI Higher School of Design, and the 
                        <span class="highlighted-text">expert panel awarded it the highest distinction</span>: a 10/10 grade.</p>
