                    <p>Foodle is designed to help young people discover suitable ways to save their food at home. It is an app that uses an iterative process or 
                        decision tree to navigate and narrow down possible ways to handle their food, hence, preventing them from wasting it.</p>

                    <p>Imagine Foodle as a personal assistant that you can easily refer to when you are not sure if the sprouting potatoes in your pantry 
                        are still safe to eat and when you don’t know what else to do with them.</p>

                        <p>The initial challenge, presented during the Master’s in User Experience and Interface Design at ESDI Higher School of Design, was:

                        <p>The issue of food and food waste is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today, encompassing both social and 
                            environmental considerations. By throwing away food, we are also wasting the resources and energy used in its cultivation, 
                            harvesting, transportation, and packaging. The extent of this problem can be seen in the statistics from the World Wildlife 
                            Fund (WWF), which reports that food waste is responsible for 10% of total greenhouse gas emissions, a staggering amount that 
                            rivals the emissions produced by all cars in the US and Europe combined.</p> 

                        <p>In Catalonia:</p>

                        <p>We began by identifying the ages that fall under the young people group. According to the United Nations, these are persons between 
                            the ages of 15 to 24 years. But since our challenge relates to consumption, we expanded this by identifying what ages are 
                            classified as a young consumer—a person who purchases goods and services for personal use. And based on the diagram below, 
                            young consumers are those people under 40 years of age.</p>
                        
                        <p>We also decided to focus on people living in Barcelona as our team was based here during the research.</p>

                        <p>At the start of the project, we recognized our limited understanding of the challenges related to food consumption and waste. 
                            To bridge this gap, we conducted research to better understand the target audience’s lifestyle and approach to food management.

                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>We noticed a repeated and common problem among the participants: they struggle to avoid wasting food they cannot consume in time.
                            This led us to consider it as a key problem to address through this project.</p>

                            the problem at hand, we conducted a second round of interviews focusing on the following areas:</p>

                            <p>We discovered that most people are unsure how to maximize the use of the food they have at home and how to avoid wasting them.</p>

                            <p>Identified pain points include: Purchasing food in bulk due to economic advantages but failing to consume it all, 
                                difficulty understanding food expiration labels and imited awareness of proper storage methods to extend food freshness.

                        <p>As we narrowed down our focus, we drafted 3 point-of-view statements that helped us generate more clarity and describe who we are designing 
                            for specifically. From this, we took the opportunity to look back and decided to carry on with our challenge statement.</p>

                        <h1>IDEATE</h1>

                        <p>We employed various ideation techniques to devise the appropriate solution to the problem. At first, we realised that, after doing a 
                            benchmark, most of our ideas during our first few brainstorming sessions were already available in numerous apps. So we initiated to 
                            reevaluate the data we have, explored some concepts—combining some ideas from the previous sessions, and came up with the following:</p>

                        <div class="featured-block-single">
                            <div class="featured-item-single">
                                <p>A portal that has access to possible solutions in preventing harmful food waste.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="featured-item-single">
                                <p>A community platform that gives easier and more convenient access to all food banks or solidarity fridges in the area.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>    

                        <p>We decided to go with the 1st concept that we believe is more fitting to address the issue we aim to solve and could generate more impact 
                            on the users. Building up to this, we initially thought of creating a website that displays all the solution information for each food—fresh 
                            produce.</p>

                        </picture>

                        <p>But we didn't move forward with this because we wish to create a product that is more than just an information dump.</p>
                    </div> 

                    <div class="content-item">
                        <h3>Getting to the final solution</h3>

                        <p>In the interviews, we learned that Google is the go-to platform when searching for information or seeking to solve a 
                            problem. So we decided to conduct a usability test to understand how the users utilize it—the process and the things 
                            they look at and consider.</p>

                        <p>Here’s what people had to say:.</p>

                        <div class="featured-block">
                            <div class="featured-item">
                                <p>"I look at the website first if it’s trusted."</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="featured-item">
                                <p>"“The search results are complicated to read.”</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="featured-item">
                                <p>“There’s too much ads!”</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="featured-item">
                                <p>“Oh… this info is different from what it says in the summary.”</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Drawing on the users' feedback—information on Google is scattered and sometimes inaccurate, we focused on exploring ways to change 
                            and improve the way they get the information they need while taking into account that it will likely be used in the kitchen while 
                            preparing food or organizing their pantry/fridge.</p>

                        <p>Moreover, we opted to design a mobile app given the user's context and the visibility aspect to a wider audience. Based on the diagram 
                            below, internet users who use their mobile devices have exponentially increased compared to those on desktops in just a couple of years.</p>

                        <p>Hence, here is our final solution: Foodle, a flow-based food waste management app that helps people discover suitable </p>

                        <p>In addition, for this project, we proposed to collaborate the app with the government of Barcelona, giving credibility 
                            to the information it provides and making it non-lucrative.</p>

                        <p>Now, it's time to visualize what we want to build. Drawing rough sketches of the screens gave us a good understanding 
                            of what elements we will include and let us establish a user flow.</p>

                    <div class="content-item">
                        <h3>More research and survey</h3>

                        <p>Foodle is all about giving users info on the food they're interested in. We've looked into what people often eat and waste, and got 
                            input from young professionals in Barcelona through a survey. As a result, we've decided to focus on fruits and vegetables for our MVP.</p>

                    <p>We also asked them which formats of presenting the information they find most effective and engaging. This helped us to conclude the optimal 
                        way to convey information through the app.</p>

                    <h1>LEARNINGS</h1>
                    
                    <p>Responsible consumption is a huge topic to tackle, so we decided to focus on the issue of food 
                        to narrow down the area of investigation and seek viable solutions. The food waste issue is 
                        not a new topic of interest. A lot of people have attempted to solve this problem and many 
                        applications have already existed but are not certain effective. This made it more challenging 
                        for us as we had to figure out a new user-centered design to try solve this issue, something 
                        that will bring value to the users.</p>

                    <p>The development of Foodle required us to do a lot of research and design thinking techniques. 
                        A lot of time was spent on desk research, interviews, data analysis, and ideation. One of the 
                        misconceptions we had was the idea to improve the experience of food organization and planning 
                        from when they shop from the groceries. It was a mistake because all the ideas we could possibly 
                        think of already exist. Also, when we assessed this against the problems and needs of the users 
                        involved, we realized that it doesn’t directly solve the issues. So we had to revisit our data 
                        and re-sort them.</p>

                    <p>We were reminded by our teachers not to fall in love with the ideas we create. It’s quite true 
                        as what I had observed with my team members. When they were so convinced with what we have 
                        formed and found out it’s not going to work, it disheartened them. So I knew I had to step up 
                        and put myself out to get to the solution concept we now have, that is, an app that uses a decision 
                        tree to provide the appropriate method to maximize food use.</p>

                    <p>Doing sprints was the key in making our design a success. By testing our design ideas as we developed 
                        them, it allowed us to discover the usability issues fast and continuously improve the interface and 
                        experience of our digital product. It was liberating to learn that in creating a user-centered design, 
                        nothing works perfectly for the first time and there will always be something to enhance as you test it 
                        with different users. Hence, it is crucial to identify the MVP of the product to concentrate on the features 
                        that appeal more to the user.</p>

                    <p>If I were to do this project again, I would form the interview questions differently as a lot of them seemed 
                        redundant and I would look deeper into the people’s habits, what they really waste and what causes it. I 
                        would also seek for an expert in the field (which we have failed to do) to learn the viable ways to handle 
                        food accurately, and what they think we should do to avoid food wasting.</p>
