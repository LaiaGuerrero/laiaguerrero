                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Croqueteo is a <b>unique food truck concept</b> that brings a fun and flirtatious 
                        twist to the classic croqueta. By blending the words "croqueta" and 
                        "coqueteo," the brand aims to <b>showcase croquetas as a lovely culinary 
                        experience</b>, inviting customers to indulge in this iconic Spanish delicacy 
                        with a captivating approach.</p>

                    <p>Imagine Croqueteo as a street food experience where each bite offers a flirtatious 
                        wink, transforming the traditional croqueta into a bold statement of flavour and 
                        fun. The visual identity reflects this vibe, using bright colours and cheeky 
                        design elements that capture the essence of playful indulgence.</p>

                        <p>We began the project by researching the food truck market in Barcelona, 
                            quickly <b>identifying music festivals as a primary venue for food truck 
                            consumption</b>. Consequently, we decided to focus our investigation on this 
                            sector, as <b>Barcelona hosts over 50 cultural and music festivals each year</b>, 
                            some attracting more than 250,000 attendees — this environment presented a <b>strong 
                            business opportunity</b>.</p>

                        <p class="blue-text">Many of these festivals have designated food truck areas, so positioning ourselves within 
                            this environment could offer substantial growth potential.</p>

                        <p>From here <b>we decided to focus our research on the sector of food trucks that are 
                            placed at music festivals</b>. To better understand this competitive landscape, we conducted 
                            a thorough competitor analysis, focusing on five of the city’s most attended events: 
                            <a href="http://https://www.primaverasound.com/es">Primavera Sound</a>, 
                            <a href="https://sonar.es/es">Sónar</a>, 
                            <a href="https://www.cruillabarcelona.com/ca/">Festival Cruïlla</a>, 
                            <a href="https://palomarketfest.com/">Palo Alto Market</a> and 
                            <a href="https://www.sharefestival.org/">Share Festival</a>.</p>

                        <p>We examined the current gastronomic offerings at these events. Here you can see a chart with 
                            <b>the most common gastronomic offers of food trucks at music festivals in Barcelona</b>:</p>

                        <p class="blue-text">Our research revealed a noticeable gap in the food truck market specialising in
                             croquettes. While today’s music festivals boast a vibrant variety of street food options, 
                             no establishments focus on this beloved Spanish delicacy.</p>

                        <h3>Survey</h3>

                        <p>We conducted a survey to gauge interest in a croqueta food truck concept, gathering responses from 
                            50 Barcelona residents who had attended at least one music festival in the past two years. Here 
                            are some insights we get:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>82%</b> had never seen a croqueta-specialised food truck.</li>
                            <li><b>74%</b> believed a croqueta food truck would be novel and appealing.</li>
                            <li><b>62%</b> stated they would try a croqueta food truck if available at a festival.</li>
                            <li>Among participants aged <b>18-35</b>, <b>78%</b> expressed particular interest in trying 
                                the croqueta food truck.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="blue-text">These insights highlighted a strong potential demand within the 18-35 age group, 
                            which is also the most popular audience for music festivals.</p>

                        <h3>Business idea</h3>

                        <p>Croquetas are small, breaded, and fried pastries filled with ingredients like béchamel sauce mixed 
                            with meats, cheeses, or vegetables. Their versatility and delicious flavour make them an ideal 
                            choice for our food truck, with other several key advantages:</p>

                                <b>Ease of cooking and consumption</b>: Croquetas are convenient for street food—they are easy to 
                                prepare and can be enjoyed on the go at festivals.
                            </li>

                                croquetas cater to diverse tastes.

                                <b>Popularity of Spanish cuisine</b>: As a beloved Spanish snack, croquetas appeal to both 
                                locals and tourists.
                            </li>

                                <b>Limited competition</b>: The food truck market currently lacks vendors specialising in croquetas, 
                                enabling us to establish a unique niche.

                        <p>The concept behind this project is coqueteo (flirting in English), the playful act of flirting or 
                            giving affectionate signals without full commitment. Playing on the words "coqueteo" 
                            and "croqueta," we’ve named our food truck <b>CROQUETEO</b>.</p>
                        
                        <p class="blue-text">This concept positions croquetas as fun and flirtatious without veering into overtly suggestive 
                            territory, creating a unique and playful identity for the brand.</p>
                        
                        <p class="blue-text">CROQUETEO aims to transform croquetas into a pleasurable experience, making them both visually 
                            and gastronomically appealing for the target.</p>
