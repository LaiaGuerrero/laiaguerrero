                        By blending the words “croqueta” and “coqueteo,” Croqueteo aims to showcase croquettes as a <span class="highlighted-text"> romantic dining experience</span>,

                        <p>We began this project by researching Barcelona's food truck market, quickly <span class="highlighted-text">identifying music festivals as a 
                            prime venue for food truck consumption</span>. Given that Barcelona hosts over 50 cultural and music festivals 
                            annually—some attracting more than 250,000 attendees—this environment presented a <span class="highlighted-text">strong business opportunity</span>.</p>

                        <p>From here we decided to focus our research on the sector of food trucks that are 
                            placed at <span class="highlighted-text">music festivals</span>. To better understand this competitive landscape, we conducted 
                            a thorough <span class="highlighted-text">competitor analysis</span>, focusing on five of the city’s most attended events: 
                            <a href="http://https://www.primaverasound.com/es">Primavera Sound</a>, 
                            <a href="https://sonar.es/es">Sónar</a>, 
                            <a href="https://www.cruillabarcelona.com/ca/">Festival Cruïlla</a>, 
                            <a href="https://palomarketfest.com/">Palo Alto Market</a> and 
                            <a href="https://www.sharefestival.org/">Share Festival</a>.</p>

                        <p>We examined the current gastronomic offerings at these events. Here you can see a chart with 
                            <b>the most common gastronomic offers of food trucks at music festivals in Barcelona</b>:</p>

                        <p>Our research revealed a <span class="highlighted-text">noticeable gap</span> in the food truck market specialising in croquettes. 
                            While today’s music festivals boast a vibrant variety of street food options, <span class="highlighted-text">no establishments focus on croquettes, a beloved

                        <p> CROQUETEO aims to transform croquetas into a <span class="highlighted-text">pleasurable experience</span>, making them both visually 
                            and gastronomically <span class="highlighted-text">appealing for the target</span>.</p>

                        <h3>Visual style and Tone of Communication</h3>

                        <p>While the concept treats croquetas as a refined yet accessible pleasure, we are intentionally <span class="highlighted-text">steering away from 
                            traditional gourmet aesthetics</span> (e.g., black and gold colours, classic fonts,etc). </p>
                        
                        <p>Instead, we propose a <span class="highlighted-text">lighthearted tone</span> that embraces playful symbols and flirtatious iconography, making the brand 
                            accessible to an audience that doesn’t resonate with conventional luxury codes. The visual style is designed to be 
                           <span class="highlighted-text">kitsch</span>, adding a <span class="highlighted-text">quirky, approachable charm</span> that aligns with the "flirting" theme</b>.</p>

                        <p>The tone of communication Croqueteo is <span class="highlighted-text">bold, cheeky, and irresistibly fun</span>. Humor and irony are key elements, with a casual yet 
                        confident voice. This approach ensures the brand remains approachable, unapologetically kitsch, and brimming with personality, 
                        just like its irresistible croquetas.</p>

                        <p>To capture the playful and flirtatious spirit of CROQUETEO, we developed a <span class="highlighted-text">moodboard</span> that explores the

                        <h3>Logo Design</h3>

                        <p>To bring the CROQUETEO concept to life, we started with <span class="highlighted-text">hand-drawn logo sketches</span>. The initial 
                            drafts focused on creating a <span class="highlighted-text">text-based logo</span>, modifying the letter O to make the typography 
                            unique. </p>
                        
                        <p>We were clear that we <span class="highlighted-text">did not want to include symbols of croquetas</span> or any direct references 
                            to love or flirting</b> (like hearts, etc.). Instead, we aimed to introduce the concept of flirting in a subtle way: 
                            <span class="highlighted-text">two dots on 0 suggest two people ‘flirting’</span>.</p>

                        <p>Another essential aspect of the brand experience is creating the space where customers will enjoy their meals. This place must be
                            <span class="highlighted-text">cute, charming and must encourage people to stay there eating, chatting... and who knows,

                        <p>That's why we proposed a space with stools and high tables, a set-up easy to transport, but also creating a
                            stylish and relaxed atmosphere conducive to good conversation and funny experiences.</p>

                    <h1>LEARNINGS</h1>

                    <p>The Croqueteo project has been an <span class="highlighted-text">incredibly enriching experience</span> for me as a designer, pushing me 
                        to explore new creative territories while reinforcing the importance of user-centered design.</p>

                    <p>A key learning from this project was <span class="highlighted-text">the importance of embracing ambiguity</span>. The abstract nature 
                        of the concept, focusing on a playful and flirtatious approach to the food truck experience, presented challenges in ensuring that 
                        the visual elements were engaging without being overly literal. </p> 

                    <p> By staying true to the concept of "coqueteo" and allowing room for creative expression, <span class="highlighted-text">I discovered 
                        that not every aspect of a brand has to be immediately obvious</span> or directly linked to the product.</p>
                    
                    <p>During the research and ideation phases, <span class="highlighted-text">I realized that building a strong emotional connection with 
                        the target audience is crucial.</span> The importance of consistency in how playful elements are applied across all brand materials 
                        became clear, as it helped solidify the brand’s personality and made it more recognizable and memorable.</p>
                    
                    <p> I also learned that <span class="highlighted-text">Iteration and testing are vital for refining ideas</span> and ensuring that the 
                        final design works as intended.</p> 
                        
                    <p>The feedback collected during the testing phase was incredibly valuable, providing insights into how the logo and other visual 
                        elements could be more effective and legible in real-life applications. This process emphasized the <span class="highlighted-text">
                        necessity of maintaining a flexible mindset</span> and continuously improving designs based on user reactions.</p>
                    
                    <p>If I were to revisit this project, I would dedicate <span class="highlighted-text">more time to exploring the cultural and social 
                        factors that influence how people connect with food brands.</span> Understanding these deeper layers would allow for a more 
                        nuanced and targeted design strategy. Additionally, I would involve a broader range of user perspectives earlier in the process 
                        to ensure that the branding truly speaks to a wide audience while maintaining its playful core.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ultimately, <span class="highlighted-text">Croqueteo has not only strengthened my skills in branding and visual communication</span> 
                        but also reaffirmed the value of a well-executed creative concept that is both bold and adaptable.
                    
                    <p>t’s a reminder that <span class="highlighted-text">successful design is not just about aesthetics, but about creating experiences that 
                        resonate with users on a deeper, emotional level.</span></p>
