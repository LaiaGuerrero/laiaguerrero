                        <p>We began this project by researching Barcelona's food truck market, quickly <b>identifying music festivals as a 
                            prime venue for food truck consumption</b>. Given that Barcelona hosts over 50 cultural and music festivals 
                            annually—some attracting more than 250,000 attendees—this environment presented a <b>strong business opportunity</b>.</p>

                            <p class="blue-text">Many of these festivals have designated food truck areas, so positioning ourselves within 
                                this environment could offer substantial growth potential.</p>

                        <p>From here <b>we decided to focus our research on the sector of food trucks that are 
                            placed at music festivals</b>. To better understand this competitive landscape, we conducted 
                            a thorough competitor analysis, focusing on five of the city’s most attended events: 
                            <a href="http://https://www.primaverasound.com/es">Primavera Sound</a>,

                            <a href="https://www.sharefestival.org/">Share Festival</a>.</p>

                        <p>We examined the current gastronomic offerings at these events. Here you can see a chart with 
                            <b>the most common gastronomic offers of food trucks at music festivals in Barcelona</b>:</p>

                        <p>We conducted a survey to gauge interest in a croqueta food truck concept, gathering responses from 
                            50 Barcelona residents who had attended at least one music festival in the past two years. Here

                        <h3>Creative concept and Naming</h3>

                        <p>The concept behind this project is coqueteo (flirting in English), the playful act of flirting or 
                            giving affectionate signals without full commitment. Playing on the words "coqueteo" 
                            and "croqueta," we’ve named our food truck <b>CROQUETEO</b>.</p>
                        
                        <p>This concept positions croquetas as fun and flirtatious without veering into overtly suggestive 
                            territory, creating a unique and playful identity for the brand.</p>
                        
                        <p class="blue-text">CROQUETEO aims to transform croquetas into a pleasurable experience, making them both visually 
                            and gastronomically appealing for the target.</p>

                    <div class="content-item">
                        <h3>Visual style and Tone of Communication</h3>

                        <p>While the concept treats croquetas as a refined yet accessible pleasure, we are intentionally <b>steering away from 
                            traditional gourmet aesthetics</b> (e.g., black and gold colours, classic fonts). </p>
                        
                        <p>Instead, we propose a <b>lighthearted tone</b> that embraces playful symbols and flirtatious iconography, making the brand 
                            accessible to an audience that doesn’t resonate with conventional luxury codes. The visual style is designed to be 
                           <b>kitsch, adding a quirky, approachable charm that aligns with the "flirting" theme</b>.</p>

                        <p>The tone of communication Croqueteo is <b>bold, cheeky, and irresistibly fun</b>. Humor and irony are key elements, with a casual yet 
                            confident voice. This approach ensures the brand remains approachable, unapologetically kitsch, and brimming with personality, 
                            just like its irresistible croquetas.</p>

                            that reflect sensuality, beauty, and charm. These references guide our brand's aesthetic direction: </p>

                                <p>Cupid, or Eros, is the god of love in Greek and Roman mythology. He is depicted as an angelic figure with a blindfold, 
                                    shooting arrows that make people fall in love. <b>The myth can serve as a reference due to its long-standing iconography 
                                    associated with love</b> and the possible connection to the concept of “blind love.”</p>

                                <p>The Rococo movement, originating in France, is characterised by <b>light, soft, and luminous colours</b>. It emphasises themes of
                                nature, mythology, the human form, Eastern art, and love while lacking religious influences. Rococo reflects the refined, exotic,
                                and sensual aspects of daily life and human relationships, making it an appropriate reference for the visual identity of CROQUETEO.</p>

                                <p>The French New Wave cinema of the 1950s, led by directors like Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut, portrayed <b>women as
                                    muses—sensual and flirtatious</b>. Actresses such as Anna Karina and Emmanuelle Riva became symbols of seduction in films like
                                    Une femme est une femme and À bout de souffle, highlighting gestures that convey flirtation, such asrunning a finger
                                    across the lips.</p>

                                <p>Throughout cinema history, powerful women have emerged as <b>global icons of beauty and sensuality</b>, including Marilyn Monroe,
                                    Brigitte Bardot, Ava Gardner, and Elizabeth Taylor. Their professional and personal lives have created a </b>collective imagery

                        <h1>Ideate</h1>

                        <p>To capture the playful and flirtatious spirit of CROQUETEO, we developed a moodboard that explores the visual language we wanted to 
                            convey. The images include <b>vibrant colors, quirky patterns, and kitsch-inspired elements</b> that align with the fun and approachable 
                            character of the brand.</p>

                        <p>To bring the CROQUETEO concept to life, we started with hand-drawn logo sketches. The initial drafts focused on creating a <b>
                            text-based logo</b>, modifying the letter O to make the typography unique. </p>
                        
                        <img src="../../../resource/img/project_overview.png" alt="Logo sketches">

                        <p>We were clear that we <b>did not want to include symbols of croquetas or any direct references to love or flirting</b> (like hearts, etc.). 
                            Instead, we aimed to introduce the concept of flirting in a subtle way: <b>two dots on 0 suggest two people ‘flirting’</b>.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>Another essential aspect of the brand experience is creating the space where customers will enjoy their meals. This place must be
                            <b>cute, charming and must encourage people to stay there eating, chatting... and who knows, even flirting</b>.</p> 
                            
                        <p>That's why we proposed a space with stools and high tables, a set-up easy to transport, but also creating a stylish and relaxed
                            atmosphere conducive to good conversation and funny experiences.</p>

                        <p>With the moodboard, logo, and setup defined, we moved into the testing phase to <b>evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
                            creative concept, “Croqueteo,”</b> for the food truck. This step allows us to <b>refine key elements and make improvements</b> before
                            developing the full range of brand applications.</p>

                            and have attended at least one music festival in the past year.</p>

                        <p>These conversations allowed us to explore their opinions in depth, providing valuable insights into their perceptions of the
                            CROQUETEO brand and visual identity. Some interesting feedback we got:</p>

                    <h1>Learnings</h1>

                    <p><b>The Croqueteo project has been an incredibly enriching experience</b> for me as a designer, pushing me to explore new creative
                         territories while reinforcing the importance of user-centered design. </p>

                    <p>A key learning from this project was <b>the importance of embracing ambiguity</b>. The abstract nature of the concept, focusing 
                        on a playful and flirtatious approach to the food truck experience, presented challenges in ensuring that the visual elements 
                        were engaging without being overly literal. </p> 

                    <p class="blue-text">By staying true to the concept of "coqueteo" and allowing room for creative expression, <b>I discovered that not every aspect 
                        of a brand has to be immediately obvious or directly linked to the product.</b> </p>
                    
                    <p>During the research and ideation phases, <b>I realized that building a strong emotional connection with the target audience is 
                        crucial.</b> The importance of consistency in how playful elements are applied across all brand materials 
                            became clear, as it helped solidify the brand’s personality and made it more recognizable and memorable.</p>
                    
                    <p class="blue-text">I also learned that <b>iteration and testing are vital for refining ideas</b> and ensuring that the final design works as intended.</p> 
                        
                    <p>The feedback collected during the testing phase was incredibly valuable, providing insights into how the logo and other visual 
                        elements could be more effective and legible in real-life applications. This process emphasized the necessity of maintaining a 
                        flexible mindset and continuously improving designs based on user reactions.</p>
                    
                    <p>If I were to revisit this project, <b>I would dedicate more time to exploring the cultural and social factors that influence 
                        how people connect with food brands.</b> Understanding these deeper layers would allow for a more nuanced and targeted design 
                        strategy. Additionally, I would involve a broader range of user perspectives earlier in the process to ensure that the branding 
                        truly speaks to a wide audience while maintaining its playful core.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ultimately, <b>Croqueteo has not only strengthened my skills in branding and visual communication</b> but also reaffirmed the 
                        value of a well-executed creative concept that is both bold and adaptable.
                    
                    <p class="blue-text">It’s a reminder that successful design is not just about aesthetics, but about creating experiences that 
                        resonate with users on a deeper, emotional level.</p>
