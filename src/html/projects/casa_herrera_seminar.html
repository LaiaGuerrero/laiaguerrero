                        <p>The client, Puig (owner of Carolina Herrera), requested the design of a website for the Casa Herrera Seminar, 
                            aiming to serve as a comprehensive information hub for attendees. The page needed to include essential details 
                            such as the event date, location, agenda, dress code, and a registration form for confirming attendance. </p>
                        
                        <p>In addition, the client asked us to review feedback from previous event websites to improve the design and user
                            experience, especially focusing on streamlining registration and providing better local information for international attendees.</p>

                        <p>To inform the design of the Casa Herrera Seminar website, we began by analysing user feedback from a previous event with the same attendees. 
                            The insights provided were instrumental in identifying key areas for improvement:</p>

                                <p>Users found the previous website’s registration process frustrating, particularly due to its lack of mobile responsiveness.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="featured-item-single">
                                <p><b>Communication gaps</b></p>
                                <p>The previous site lacked an easy way for attendees to contact event organizers, causing a sense of disconnection.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="featured-item-single">
                                <p><b>Need for local information about </b></p>
                                <p>International attendees requested more details about Barcelona, such as attractions, dining, and transportation.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>These insights guided our design direction, emphasizing mobile responsiveness, the inclusion of local information, and improved 
                            communication channels with the organization team.</p>

                        <h3>Carolina Herrera’s brand guidelines</h3>

                        <p>To ensure brand consistency, I conducted an in-depth review of Carolina Herrera’s brand guidelines. The brand is globally renowned 
                            for its attention to detail, craftsmanship, and commitment to quality. Carolina Herrera’s identity is built on elegance, sophistication, 
                            and exclusivity, all of which are reflected in its designs and messaging.</p>

                        <p>Additionally, the brand emphasizes sustainability and environmental responsibility, adding further value and distinction to its offerings. 
                            For this project, it was crucial to adhere strictly to the visual and aesthetic standards outlined in the brand guidelines while 
                            incorporating elements that aligned with the Casa Herrera Seminar’s luxurious yet modern tone.</p>

                        <p>Espai Corberó, the venue for the seminar, is characterized by its modern and minimalist architecture, blending contemporary design with natural elements. 
                            The venue’s clean lines and open spaces present a perfect opportunity to integrate subtle architectural references into the website design.</p>

                        <p>The target audience for the Casa Herrera Seminar consists of internal employees and stakeholders from Puig and Carolina Herrera, ranging in age from 25 to 55.
                            This includes regional managers, marketing leads, and other professionals involved in high-responsibility roles. Most attendees are international, traveling from different parts of the world for this seminar.</p>
                        
                        <p>These attendees are busy professionals who are required to register for the event to help manage attendance and accommodation logistics. Although attendance is mandatory, the registration process needs to be quick and efficient.</p>
                       
                        <p>According to internal surveys, 74% of employees check their work email on their mobile devices, while 23% use desktop and the remaining 3% access it on other devices. Moreover, statistics from last year’s event showed that a significant
                            68% of attendees accessed the website via mobile, further reinforcing the need for a mobile-optimized design.</p>

                        <p>The audience for the Casa Herrera Seminar (and for the web) consists of Carolina Herrera and Puig employees and internal stakeholders from international markets, including regional managers, marketing leads, and other high-responsibility roles.</p>
                        
                        <p>These professionals are flying into Barcelona specifically to attend the seminar, and they typically work full-time, managing demanding schedules. Time is valuable for them, so the registration process and attendance confirmation must be quick, efficient, and accessible.</p>

                        <p>The company communicates regularly with its employees by digital means, as they all have a company telephone and a computer. Including all relevant information for the event on a single website is a priority, as these professionals receive a lot of emails every day and segmenting the information into different messages can cause them to miss out on relevant information.</p>

                        <p>The website should be not only functional and user-friendly but also convey a sense of beauty, ensuring a seamless experience for the user while embodying the brand’s luxurious ethos.</p>
                        
                        <p>The overall look and feel should be “cute,” with a refined color palette that integrates the iconic red of the Carolina Herrera brand, while incorporating soft pinks to add a fresh, modern touch.

                        <p>The logo, color palette, and typography provided by the client are crucial for preserving the Carolina Herrera brand identity throughout the website. The client developed a visual identity for the Casa Herrera Seminar, which will be applied across all communication materials, both online and offline, to ensure consistency across the entire campaign.</p>
                        
                        <p>The seminar’s logo is presented here:</p>

                        <p>The color palette combines soft pink tones with a slightly adjusted version of Carolina Herrera’s signature red, emphasizing the brand’s luxurious and sophisticated aesthetic. The original color palette, defined by the client, was in CMYK, so it will be converted to HEX to ensure an optimal online experience.</p>

                        <p>For the typography, the client selected Bigilia for large headings and Gotham Book for body text. On the website, Bigilia will be used for major titles (H1, H2) as it conveys the event’s elegance, but due to its complexity at smaller sizes, we’ll limit its usage to larger text to preserve readability. For smaller titles, I’ve chosen Gotham Bold, which maintains a strong presence without compromising legibility. Gotham Book will be used for the body text, offering clarity and complementing the other fonts.</p>

                    <h1>LEARNINGS</h1>

                    <p>Designing and developing the Casa Herrera Seminar website has been an immensely enriching experience that has expanded my skills in both UX/UI design and adapting brand strategies to digital platforms. This project allowed me to apply my web design knowledge while also adapting to the specific guidelines of a prestigious brand like Carolina Herrera.</p>

                    <p>One key learning was the importance of balancing aesthetics with functionality. In creating a website that reflects the brand’s sophistication and luxury, I was challenged to maintain a visually appealing interface without compromising the user experience. The design had to be intuitive, allowing smooth navigation, especially on mobile devices, given the “mobile-first” design approach. </p> 

                    <p>This experience reinforced my ability to create interfaces that are not only visually impactful but also meet the needs of the user.</p>
                    
                    <p>Another fundamental aspect was the process of adapting the brand’s visual elements to the web. Using the colour palette, typography, and graphics provided by the client challenged me to preserve the integrity of the brand while designing a cohesive digital experience. I learned to work with colours and fonts in an online environment, adjusting brand guidelines to maximize readability and user experience. The decision to test different user flow options for the registration page was also crucial, as I understood the importance of iteration and usability testing to optimize conversion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Working collaboratively with other professionals, such as project manager and developers, was another major learning opportunity. Through the handoff design process, I gained a better understanding of the importance of providing clear and detailed specifications to ensure the design is correctly implemented in code. This helped me improve my communication and coordination skills within multidisciplinary teams.</p> 
                        
                    <p>In summary, this project provided a valuable opportunity to further refine my user-centred design approach, adapting a strong brand identity into an intuitive digital experience, while understanding the significance of collaboration and testing in the design process.</p>
